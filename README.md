## Introduction

This repository are for my dotfiles (user configurations)

## How to setup

To start using my configuration you need [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) (to install on arch just *pacman -S stow*)

After having stow installed all you need to do is clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smoodle/dotfiles
```

after the clone is done just stow the configs you need


```bash
stow nvim
stow zsh
```
